To maintain consistent, high-quality code across the team, DataPY uses pre-commit hooks to automatically format, lint, and type-check your code before you commit.

This ensures:

All code is formatted with black

Imports are clean and ordered using isort

Type errors are caught early with mypy

One-time Setup (Per Developer)
You only need to do this once per machine/clone

Install dev dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
Install the pre-commit Git hook

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit install
(Recommended) Run it once on the whole codebase

bash
Copy
Edit
pre-commit run --all-files
This will auto-fix formatting issues and show type errors (if any).

Hook Configuration: .pre-commit-config.yaml
This file is committed in the repo and defines the exact tools and versions we use:

repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 24.3.0
    hooks:
      - id: black

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-isort
    rev: v5.12.0
    hooks:
      - id: isort

  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-mypy
    rev: v1.2.0
    hooks:
      - id: mypy
 How It Works
After setup:

Every time you run git commit, the hooks will:

Format your code (black)

Sort your imports (isort)

Check for typing errors (mypy)

If any check fails, the commit is blocked with a helpful message.

You can fix the issues and re-commit.
