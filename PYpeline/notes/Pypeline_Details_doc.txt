PYpeline:

Terminologies:

Line in which data flows

Pype

in which control flows

Pypes will have Valves with control settings (order: condition)




Control always flows to the most priority pypes firstl priority is carry forwarded to the lower pypes(priority DFS) 



Modules - Does one logical work



In our framework any Module one of the below 4 catagories:




Module               Line                    Pype 


Tanks             No In no Out          yes in yes out
Taps(source)      No In only Out        yes in yes out
Sink(sinks)       Yes In No out         no In Yes out
Mods(transform)   yes In  Yes Out       No in No out

Pods are logical boundaries forms around modules that have lines pype form pods boundaries 



Pods are interlinkes via pypes connected to the modules inside them



pods together forms a flows



There cannot be a isolated pod inside a flow

lines have 0.5 as order

v1:: only (order:condition)
v2:: iterate support (either as a control module or pype like (order:iterate)
v3:: Order 0 support (Similar to On componet ok, starts the nest pod immidietly in parallel)
v4 :: support for 2 order with same value, both of those pods will be launched in parallel
v4:: new sync gates componets other advance stuff

All will be done in python
